Mechanics with Python
=================================================

Introduction
------------

**About**

Welcome to mechanics-with-python, some tutorials from my personal notes to simulate theoretical concepts of ME211 (Mechanics of Machines) and their practical application using Python libraries.

.. admonition:: Inspiration

   This repository is inspired by the excellent resources provided by `Senior Lecturer D.H.S. Maithripala <https://github.com/mugalan/classical-mechanics-from-a-geometric-point-of-view>`_ of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. His course, ME211, delves into the fundamental principles of mechanics of machines, equipping you with a strong foundation for future studies and practical applications.

**Contents**

- Python libraries for mechanics (SymPy, SciPy, matplotlib, plotly)
- Code examples and explanations
- Questions and answers based on ME211 course materials
- Additional resources (tutorials, documentation, online communities)

**Why Python for Mechanics?**

- Clear and concise syntax
- Powerful libraries for symbolic manipulation, numerical calculations, and visualization
- Versatility for solving simple equations to simulating complex mechanisms
- Large and supportive Python community

   This repository is from my personal notes for ME211, might contain some mistakes. The example questions, answers and images are referred from the course materials for ME211 in UOP. Always refer to `Senior Lecturer Maithripala's course materials <https://github.com/mugalan/classical-mechanics-from-a-geometric-point-of-view>`_ and lectures for the comprehensive theoretical understanding.
